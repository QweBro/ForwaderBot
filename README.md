# ForwaderBot
APP_ID and API_HASH - Get it from my.telegram.org
CHAT_IDS - The IDs of the main channel from where posts have to be copied, split by space. eg: -100xxxx -100yyyy -100abcd ...
DESTINATION_CHAT_ID - The ID of the channel to which the posts are to be sent, split by space. eg: -100xxxx -100yyyy -100abcd ...
#chatid - chat id where does the message come from
#destination - chat id where are the messages sent
FORBIDDEN_WORDS - Words that, if present in the message, the message will not be sent.
The account must be a member of the group from which the messages are being fetched.
In the next version, I plan to add a check to see whether the message has been sent or not to prevent message duplication. 
I would be glad to hear your suggestions for improving this bot.
